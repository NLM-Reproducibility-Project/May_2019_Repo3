# May_2019_Repo3

As part of the National Library of Medicine Reproducibility Workshop concluded on May 16, 2019
We sought to reproduce the study published by Schmid et. al., 2018 
  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.07.104
  
To simplify software installation and data acquisition we have posted three jupyter notebooks:
  - InstallNeededPrograms_30157438.ipynb 
  - DownloadNeededData_30157438.ipynb
  - InstallGenomeAssemblies.ipynb
  
We have begun converting the rmd files documented in manschmi/MexNab_3seq to jupyter notebooks that could be followed line by line:
  - 1_QC_and_mapping.ipynb
  - 2_GenomicA_masking.ipynb
  - 3_Sp_normalization.ipynb
  
This is in no way a completed endeavor, however we commend Schmid et al., in their documentation and feel confident that given sufficient time we would have been successful in reproducing their data analysis pipeline.
